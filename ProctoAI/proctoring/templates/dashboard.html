                <ol>
                    <li><strong> Device and Internet</strong>: Ensure your device is fully charged or connected to a reliable power source and has a stable, high-speed internet connection for the entire duration of the exam.</li>
                    <li><strong> Webcam and Microphone</strong>: Keep your webcam and microphone turned on at all times. These are mandatory for real-time monitoring during the exam.</li>
                    <li><strong> No Unauthorized Tabs or Devices</strong>: Refrain from opening additional browser tabs, applications, or using external devices such as phones, smartwatches, or notes during the session.</li>
                    <li><strong> Stay in Frame</strong>: Ensure your face is clearly visible in the webcam frame throughout the exam. Avoid looking away from the screen frequently.</li>
                    <li><strong> Quiet and Distraction-Free Environment</strong>: Select a quiet location where you wonâ€™t be interrupted. Background noise or distractions may lead to your session being flagged.</li>
                    <li><strong> Individual Effort Only</strong>: The examination is strictly individual. Any form of collaboration or communication with others is prohibited.</li>
                    <li><strong> Behavior Monitoring</strong>: Be aware that AI systems and live proctors may monitor your activity, including webcam and microphone feeds. Suspicious activities will be flagged for review.</li>
                    <li><strong> Consequences of Rule Violations</strong>: Any violation of these rules, including misconduct or suspicious behavior, may lead to immediate termination of your exam session, invalidation of your results, and possible disciplinary action.</li>
